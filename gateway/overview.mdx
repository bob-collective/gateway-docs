## What is BOB Gateway?

BOB Gateway is a Bitcoin intent bridge that unlocks Bitcoin liquidity by reducing the number of steps to onboard users to your app. Users can go from **BTC** on Bitcoin to various DeFi protocols with a single Bitcoin transaction.

## How It Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="User Initiates">
    User requests a quote through your app for their desired DeFi action (stake, swap, bridge, etc.)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Quote Generation">
    Gateway API provides a quote with routing, fees, and estimated output
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Bitcoin Transaction">
    User signs a single Bitcoin transaction that includes order parameters in OP_RETURN
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verification & Execution">
    Bitcoin Light Client verifies the transaction on-chain, and the protocol executes the DeFi action
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Delivery">
    User receives their tokens or staking position directly in their EVM wallet
