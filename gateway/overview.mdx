## Why Gateway?

Unlock native Bitcoin liquidity for the entire crypto ecosystem.

Bitcoin holders face significant friction when accessing DeFi opportunities - requiring multiple transactions, bridging steps, and complex wallet interactions. Gateway eliminates these barriers by enabling direct settlement from native BTC into any DeFi position across chains.

Whether you're building a DeFi protocol, wallet, or aggregator - Gateway provides the infrastructure to tap into Bitcoin's $1T+ in liquidity with minimal integration effort.

## What is BOB Gateway?

BOB Gateway is a permissionless intent - and RFQ - based protocol that enables frictionless movement of Bitcoin into DeFi.
It connects Bitcoin holders and DeFi opportunities across chains, enabling settlement of native BTC into any assets or DeFi positions - from Bitcoin to DeFi in a single transaction.
