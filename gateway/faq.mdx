## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>

<Accordion icon="gas-pump" title="Who pays the gas fees?">
The Relayer estimates gas costs upfront and deducts them from the transaction. Users don't need ETH on BOB to use Gateway.
</Accordion>

<Accordion icon="triangle-exclamation" title="What happens if my DeFi action fails?">
Gateway automatically falls back to sending the wrapped BTC directly to the user's EVM address. Always test thoroughly to avoid fallbacks.
</Accordion>

<Accordion icon="wallet" title="Do I need Bitcoin wallet support?">
Yes, your frontend needs Bitcoin wallet integration. See the [wallet guide](/gateway/wallets) for implementation details.
</Accordion>

<Accordion icon="link-simple" title="Can I chain multiple protocols?">
Yes! Custom strategies can interact with multiple protocols in sequence. For example: stake WBTC → get staked BTC → deposit in lending → send receipt tokens to user.
</Accordion>

<Accordion icon="shield-check" title="Security considerations?">
- Use SafeERC20 for token transfers
- Consider reentrancy protection
- Ensure proper access controls
- Test thoroughly on testnet
</Accordion>

<Accordion icon="money-bill" title="How does affiliate fee monetization work?">
You can earn fees on every transaction which is linked to your affiliate ID. The fee is deducted from the user's input amount and sent directly to you.
</Accordion>

<Accordion icon="clock" title="How long do transactions take?">
Transaction time varies based on:
- Bitcoin network confirmation time (typically 10-60 minutes)
- Destination chain (cross-chain transactions take longer)
- Current network congestion

The quote response includes an `estimatedTxTime` field with the expected duration.
</Accordion>

<Accordion icon="arrows-rotate" title="What happens if Bitcoin fees spike after I submit?">
For offramp transactions, you can bump the transaction fee to speed up confirmation if Bitcoin network fees increase.
</Accordion>

<Accordion icon="xmark" title="Can I cancel a transaction?">
For offramp transactions, you can unlock an order if it gets stuck. This is irreversible - once unlocked, the order cannot be resumed.
</Accordion>

<Accordion icon="code-branch" title="What chains are supported?">
Gateway supports:
- **Bitcoin** → BOB (mainnet)
- **Bitcoin** → Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, Optimism (via LayerZero)
- **BOB** → Bitcoin (offramp)

Check `getRoutes()` for the complete list of available routes.
</Accordion>

<Accordion icon="shield-halved" title="Is Gateway audited?">
Yes, BOB Gateway has been audited by Pashov and Common Prefix. The protocol uses atomic cross-chain swaps verified by an on-chain Bitcoin Light Client, making it trustless between users and market makers.

</Accordion>

Fees include:
- **Protocol fee**: Charged by Gateway (included in quote)
- **Gas fees**: Estimated and deducted upfront (no ETH required from users)
- **Affiliate fees**: Optional fees you set (if monetizing your integration)
- **Bridge fees**: For cross-chain transactions

All fees are shown transparently in the quote response.
